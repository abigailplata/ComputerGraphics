# Computer Graphics
In this repository I am displaying Computer Graphics Project Assignments at UC Merced.
If downloading to view work I reccomend using Visual Studios on a Linux. When opening sigmynode make sure the sig file is in the same location as well. 
During my time in this class I struggled because I own a Macbook Pro 2012. My Macbook needs to be upgraded to a SSD since it runs very slow and can  no longer be bootcamped. In addition, acces to a Linux lab computer was difficult during this semester. Therefore a lot of my work isnt where I'd like it to be, but I tried my best with the resources I had.
